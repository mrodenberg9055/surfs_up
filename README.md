## Overview of Project

### Purpose
 - The purpose of this project was to provide information about temperature trends for the months of June and December. 

## Results
### 3 Key Takeaways
  - The average temperature for June was almost 75 degrees where the average temperature for Nov was just over 71 degrees.
  - The max temeratures for both months were over 80 degrees
  - The min temp for Dec was 56 degrees, where the min temp for June was 64 degrees
  
## Summary
### Additional Information
  - I think that we could create a summary dataframe that has more data from the database in it.  While these months may be warm enough to sustain an ice cream shop they may be more rainy than others.  
  - I think we could also determine what "warm enough" is and determine the number of days from each month per year that fall into that category.  The average may be skewed one way or the other if there are a few really hot days and everything else is below what we would consider warm.
